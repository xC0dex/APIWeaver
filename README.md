APIWeaver is a powerful and lightweight library designed to provide a seamless integration of OpenAPI and Swagger UI into your .NET 6+ apps. APIWeaver supports the latest .NET features and is designed to be future-proof, ensuring support for upcoming .NET and OpenAPI features.

## Getting Started

To get started with APIWeaver, you can install the NuGet package using your preferred package manager. In most cases, the package `APIWeaver.Swagger` is the one you are looking for.

1. Install the NuGet package

```shell
dotnet add package APIWeaver.Swagger
```

2. Add the using directive to your Program.cs file

```csharp
using APIWeaver;
```

3. Add the following lines to your `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiWeaver();

// other code

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwaggerUi();
}
```

That's it. You now have a fully functional Swagger UI in your application. The UI can be accessed by navigating to `/swagger` in your browser ðŸ¥³. A more detailed guide with more use cases can be found [here](/docs/Getting-Started.md).

## Currently supported features

- Fully functional and configurable Swagger UI (with dark mode ðŸŒ™)
- OpenAPI 3.0 generation

- .NET 6, 7 and 8 including required members, nullable types and latest validation attributes

## Roadmap

- Full `System.Text.Json` support ([Milestone](https://github.com/xC0dex/APIWeaver/milestone/1))
- Security definitions for OpenAPI documents
