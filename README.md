APIWeaver is a powerful and lightweight library designed to provide a seamless integration Swagger UI into your .NET 9+ apps. APIWeaver supports the latest .NET features and is designed to be future-proof, ensuring support for upcoming .NET and OpenAPI features.

## Getting Started

To get started with APIWeaver, you can install the NuGet package using your preferred package manager. In most cases, the package `APIWeaver.Swagger` is the one you are looking for.

1. Install the NuGet package

```shell
dotnet add package APIWeaver.Swagger
```

2. Add the using directive to your Program.cs file

```csharp
using APIWeaver;
```

3. Add the following lines to your `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApiDocument();
// other code

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();
    app.MapSwaggerUi();
}
```

That's it. You now have a fully functional Swagger UI in your application. The UI can be accessed by navigating to `/swagger` in your browser ðŸ¥³. 
## Currently supported features

- Fully functional and configurable Swagger UI
- Dark mode ðŸŒ™
- Useful extension methods

## Roadmap

- Useful transformers for OpenAPI documents and operations. Like, e.g, For Security schemes.
- Support for more OpenAPI UIs
- If I have enough time: API client generation based on the generated OpenAPI document
