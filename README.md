APIWeaver is a powerful and lightweight library that seamlessly integrates Swagger UI into your .NET 9+ applications. It is designed to be user-friendly, fully configurable, and AOT compatible. Built on top of Microsoft's built-in OpenAPI document generation, the library offers a range of extension methods and transformers to enhance OpenAPI documents and operations.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running with APIWeaver is simple:

1. **Install the NuGet package**

```shell
dotnet add package APIWeaver
```

2. **Add the necessary using directive**

```csharp
using APIWeaver;
```

3. **Configure your application**

Add the following lines to your `Program.cs` file to set up APIWeaver:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApiDocument();

// other code

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();
    app.MapSwaggerUi();
}
```

That's it! Your application now has a fully functional, native AOT-compatible Swagger UI. To view it, simply navigate to `/swagger` in your browser ðŸ¥³.
