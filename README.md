APIWeaver is a powerful and lightweight library that seamlessly integrates Swagger UI into your .NET 9+ applications. It is designed to be user-friendly, fully configurable, and AOT compatible. Built on top of Microsoft's built-in OpenAPI document generation, the library offers a range of extension methods and transformers to enhance OpenAPI documents and operations.

## Getting Started

To get started with APIWeaver, you can install the NuGet package using your preferred package manager. In most cases, the package `APIWeaver` is the one you are looking for.

1. Install the NuGet package

```shell
dotnet add package APIWeaver
```

2. Add the using directive to your Program.cs file

```csharp
using APIWeaver;
```

3. Add the following lines to your `Program.cs` file.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApiDocument();

// other code

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.MapOpenApi();
    app.MapSwaggerUi();
}
```

That's it. You now have a fully functional native AOT compatible Swagger UI in your application. The UI can be accessed by navigating to `/swagger` in your browser ðŸ¥³. 
## Currently supported features

- Fully functional and configurable Swagger UI
