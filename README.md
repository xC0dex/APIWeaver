APIWeaver is a powerful and lightweight library that integrates Swagger UI and OpenAPI support into your .NET 9 applications. It is designed to be user-friendly, fully configurable, and AOT compatible. Built on top of Microsoft's built-in OpenAPI document generation, the library offers a range of extension methods and transformers to enhance OpenAPI documents and operations.

## Features

- Fully functional and configurable Swagger UI
- Dark mode support üåô
- Native AOT compatibility
- Useful extension methods & transformers for OpenAPI documents and operations
- High test coverage ensures reliability

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install the package**

```shell
dotnet add package APIWeaver
```

2. **Add the necessary using directive**

```csharp
using APIWeaver;
```

3. **Configure your application**

Add the following to your `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenApiDocument();

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
