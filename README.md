APIWeaver is a powerful, lightweight, and feature-rich library designed to provide comprehensive OpenAPI support in .NET
6 and newer.

APIWeaver is committed to long-term development, ensuring support for upcoming .NET and OpenAPI features.

## Work in progress

This project is currently in the **active development** phase, with ongoing improvements, new features and potential API
changes. Contributions of any kind are highly appreciated!

## Getting Started
To get started with APIWeaver, you can install the NuGet package using your preferred package manager. In most cases, the package `APIWeaver.Swagger` is the one you are looking for.

1. Install the NuGet package
```shell
dotnet add package APIWeaver.Swagger
```

2. Add the using directive to your Program.cs file
```csharp
using APIWeaver.Swagger;
```

3. Add the following line to your `Program.cs` file
```csharp
builder.Services.AddApiWeaver();

// other code

if (app.Environment.IsDevelopment())
{
    app.UseSwaggerUi();
}
```

Thats it. You now have a fully functional Swagger UI in your application. The UI can be accessed by navigating to `/swagger` in your browser ðŸ¥³. A more detailed guide with more usecases can be found [here](/docs/Getting-Started.md).
