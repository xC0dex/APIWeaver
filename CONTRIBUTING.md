# Contributing to APIWeaver

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for considering contributing to APIWeaver! I'm always happy to have help improving the project.

## Start with an Issue

Got an idea or found a bug? Before jumping in, please create an issue so we can discuss it. This way we can avoid any duplicated efforts and talk about the best approach to solve the problem.

## Keep It Clean

I aim to keep the codebase clean and readable. When writing your code, please follow these simple rules:

- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and keep the code as simple as possible.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.

## Tests Matter

Every contribution should come with tests to make sure it works as expected and helps prevent future issues. Please:

- Write both unit and integration tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Use clear, descriptive names for your test cases.

## Submit a Pull Request

Once you're satisfied with your changes, feel free to submit a pull request! ðŸŽ‰

Thanks again for your contribution!
